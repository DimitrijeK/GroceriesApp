# GroceriesApp :handbag:
## WPF C# Application

This project is being developed by me. It is a Windows Presentation Foundation Application, and the idea of this app is to make it a
little easier for you and your family when it comes to keeping track of your groceries list. I recently started working on this project
and I am still working on it.
 
The next step for this app is to connect it to the database, and improve some of its UI. If you have any suggestions/questions/concerns,
feel free to contact me dkastratovic@carthage.edu :thumbsup:
